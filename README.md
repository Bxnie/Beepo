### How was Beepo Made?
Beepo is made using a few libaries but is mainly based on **node.js** using **discord.js** to interact with discord

### Can i download Beepo?
Unfortunatly no, **Beepo** although being public for you to add to your server, cannot be downloaded and run individually. however if you have any good feature suggestions DM **Beepo** and open a ticket, it may take me a while to get through tickets since I alone develop this bot.

### Who made Beepo?
Me (Bxnie), i am the soul developer and maintainer for Beepo, for now. However as the bot grows this may change
